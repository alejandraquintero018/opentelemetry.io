The OpenTelemetry Collector is a convenient place to transform data before
sending it to a vendor or other systems. This is frequently done for data
quality, goveranance, cost, and security reasons.

Processors available from the the
[Collector Contrib repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor)
support dozens of different transformations on metric, span and log data. The
following sections provide some basic examples on getting started with a few
frequently-used processors.

The configuration of processors, particularly advanced transformations, may have
a significant impact on collector performance.

## Basic filtering

**Processor**:
[filter processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/filterprocessor)

The filter processor allows users to filter telemetry based on `include` or
`exclude` rules. Include rules are used for defining "allow lists" where
anything that does _not_ match include rules is dropped from the collector.
Exclude rules are used for defining "deny lists" where telemetry that matches
rules is dropped from the collector.

For example, to _only_ allow span data from services app1, app2, and app3 and
drop data from all other services:

```yaml
processors:
  filter/allowlist:
    spans:
      include:
        match_type: strict
        services:
          - app1
          - app2
          - app3
```

To only block spans from a service called development while allowing all other
spans, an exclude rule is used:

```yaml
processors:
  filter/denylist:
    spans:
      exclude:
        match_type: strict
        services:
          - development
```

The
[filter processor docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/filterprocessor)
have more examples, including filtering on logs and metrics.

## Adding or Deleting Attributes

**Processor**:
[attributes processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/attributesprocessor)
or
[resource processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/resourceprocessor)

The attributes processor can be used to update, insert, delete, or replace
existing attributes on metrics or traces. For example, hereâ€™s a configuration
that adds an attribute called account_id to all spans:

```yaml
processors:
  attributes/accountid:
    actions:
      - key: account_id
        value: 2245
        action: insert
```

The resource processor has an identical configuration, but applies only to
[resource attributes](/docs/reference/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/).
Use the resource processor to modify infrastructure metadata related to
telemetry. For example, this inserts the Kubernetes cluster name:

```yaml
processors:
  resource/k8s:
    attributes:
      - key: k8s.cluster.name
        from_attribute: k8s-cluster
        action: insert
```

## Renaming Metrics or Metric Labels

**Processor:**
[metrics transform processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/metricstransformprocessor)

The
[metrics transform processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/metricstransformprocessor)
shares some functionality with the
[attributes processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/attributesprocessor),
but also supports renaming and other metric-specific functionality.

```yaml
processors:
  metricstransform/rename:
    transforms:
      include: system.cpu.usage
      action: update
      new_name: system.cpu.usage_time
```

The
[metrics transform processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/metricstransformprocessor)
also supports regexes to apply transform rules to multiple metric names or
metric labels at the same time. This example renames cluster_name to
cluster-name for all metrics:

```yaml
processors:
  metricstransform/clustername:
    transforms:
      - include: ^.*$
        match_type: regexp
        action: update
        operations:
          - action: update_label
            label: cluster_name
            new_label: cluster-name
```

## Enriching Telemetry with Resource Attributes

**Processor**:
[resource detection processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor)
and
[k8sattributes processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/k8sattributesprocessor)

These processors can be used for enriching telemetry with relevant
infrastructure metadata to help teams quickly identify when underlying
infrastructure is impacting service health or performance.

The resource detection processor adds relevant cloud or host-level information
to telemetry:

```yaml
processors:
  resourcedetection/system:
    # Modify the list of detectors to match the cloud environment
    detectors: [env, system, gcp, ec2, azure]
    timeout: 2s
    override: false
```

Similarly, the k8s processor enriches telemetry with relevant Kubernetes
metadata like pod name, node name, or workload name. The collector pod must be
configured to have read access to certain Kubernetes RBAC APIs, which is
documented
[here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/processor/k8sattributesprocessor#hdr-RBAC).
To use the default options, it can be configured with an empty block:

```yaml
processors:
  k8sattributes/default:
```

## Advanced Transformations

More advanced attribute transformations are also available in the
[transform processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/transformprocessor).
The transform processor allows end-users to specify transformations on metrics,
logs, and traces using the
[OpenTelemetry Transformation Language](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/pkg/ottl).

## Changing the Span Status using the Collector's Span Processor

The span processor modifies the span name based on its attributes or extract
span attributes from the span name. It also allows to change span status.

It optionally supports the ability to
[include/exclude spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/attributesprocessor/README.md#includeexclude-filtering)

The following actions are supported:

- `name:` Modify the name of attributes within a span.
- `status:` Modify the status of the span.

### Name a Span

The following setting are required:

- `from_attributes:` The attribute value for the keys are used to create a new
  name in the order specified in the configuration.

The following settings can be optionally configured:

- `separator:` A string, which is specified will be used to split values

Note: If renaming is dependent on attributes being modified by the `attributes`
processor, ensure the `span` processor is specified after the `attributes`
processor in the `pipeline` specification.

```yaml
span:
  name:
    # from_attributes represents the attribute keys to pull the values from to generate the
    # new span name.
    from_attributes: [<key1>, <key2>, ...]
    # Separator is the string used to concatenate various parts of the span name.
    separator: <value>
```

Example:

```yaml
sspan:
  name:
    from_attributes: ['db.svc', 'operation']
    separator: '::'
```

Refer to
[config.yaml](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/spanprocessor/testdata/config.yaml)
for detailed examples on using the processor.

### Extract attributes from span name

Takes a list of regular expressions to match span name against and extract
attributes from it based on subexpressions. Must be specified under the
to_attributes section.

The following settings are required:

- `rules:` A list of rules to extract attribute values from span name. The
  values in the span name are replaced by extracted attribute names. Each rule
  in the list is regex pattern string. Span name is checked against the regex
  and if the regex matches then all named subexpressions of the regex are
  extracted as attributes and are added to the span. Each subexpression name
  becomes an attribute name and subexpression matched portion becomes the
  attribute value. The matched portion in the span name is replaced by extracted
  attribute name. If the attributes already exist in the span then they will be
  overwritten. The process is repeated for all rules in the order they are
  specified. Each subsequent rule works on the span name that is the output
  after processing the previous rule.

- `break_after_match` (default = false): specifies if processing of rules should
  stop after the first match. If it is false rule processing will continue to be
  performed over the modified span name.

```yaml
span/to_attributes:
  name:
    to_attributes:
      rules:
        - regexp-rule1
        - regexp-rule2
        - regexp-rule3
        ...
      break_after_match: <true|false>
```

Example:

```yaml
# Let's assume input span name is /api/v1/document/12345678/update
# Applying the following results in output span name /api/v1/document/{documentId}/update
# and will add a new attribute "documentId"="12345678" to the span.
span/to_attributes:
  name:
    to_attributes:
      rules:
        - ^\/api\/v1\/document\/(?P<documentId>.*)\/update$
```

### Set status for span

The following setting is required:

- `code:` Represents span status. One of the following values "Unset", "Error",
  "Ok".
- The following setting is allowed only for code "Error":`description`

Example:

```yaml
# Set status allows to set specific status for a given span. Possible values are
# Ok, Error and Unset as per
# https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#set-status
# The description field allows to set a human-readable message for errors.
span/set_status:
  status:
    code: Error
    description: 'some error description'
```

Refer to
[config.yaml](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/spanprocessor/testdata/config.yaml)
for detailed examples on using the processor.
